# Network-Monitor

The program follows the software defined networking model to centralize all intelligence in order to coordinate the operations of all network devices. 
The network monitor serves as the central server while the interface monitors act as the transferring layer where all work is done communicating with the network devices.



## Motivation

Monitoring network interfaces can help in debugging system problems as well as enhancing system performance through a central intelligent networking device.
For routers and other networking equipment, it is crucial to know the performance of each interface and to control each interface.
The networking monitor program allows developers to view logs of status reports from each interface monitors the host machine has.
